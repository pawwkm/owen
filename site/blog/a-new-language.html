            <p>
                About 8 months ago I was in the middle of writing an API in C#.
                The API took a <a href="http://bford.info/pub/lang/peg.pdf">Parser Expression Grammar</a>
                as input then generated each valid string within some parameters.
                The caller specified the maximum number of repetitions and such.
                The idea was to use it for testing handwritten parsers. The API
                generated code using reflection to up the performance and
                analyzed the PEG so it could optimize the generated code. It was
                also there I realized that in real world scenarios the tests
                would run for a really long time. I mildly succeeded in using
                <code><span class="type">Parallel</span>.ForEach</code> to
                squeeze out more performance. In ideal situations execution time
                was halved. Out of curiosity I ported the single threaded
                generated code to C which was nearly identical anyway.
                Single thread performance doubled.
                The reason being that in C# I used an array of characters,
                changed them as needed and then new'ed up a <span class="type">string</span>
                from the array. That meant trillions of string constructions,
                garbage collecting them and so on. In C I just used the same array
                and poof, solid performance bump. Since then I have been
                obsessed with performance and efficiency.
            </p>

                I began looking for another programming language to use for my
                low level stuff. I already knew C... I like the power C has it's
                just clunky to program in. C++, a waterfall of no. Then D... you
                get the point, I could not find something that satisfied my
                needs. I could not find any language with the syntax, semantics
                and tooling (compilation process, refactoring etc.) I wanted.
                Looking back I think its weird that I had to see Jonathan Blow's
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH9VCN6UkyQ">Ideas about a new programming language for games</a>
                video before realizing that implementing my own programming
                language was an option considering that I have made several
                compilers from scratch before watching that video.

                Kevlin Henney has definitely influenced my language design and
                my programming in general. His talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOYkzecsunQ">Software Is Details</a>
                is excellent IMHO. Inspired by his talks I've tried to improve
                documenting unit tests and line length. At least compared to
                what I'm used to. One thing that has bugged me since day one of unit testing is
                naming tests: <code>summary_of_test_description</code> or
                <code>Method_State_Expectation</code> etc.
                IMHO these names become hard to read and maintain not to mention
                that they often stray from the naming convention normally used
                in the code base. I chose to do what D does but instead of having
                the <span class="keyword">unittest</span> keyword, I chose
                <span class="keyword">proposition</span>:
            </p>

            <pre><code><span class="comment">// Detailed explanation of the behaviour being tested.</span>
<span class="keyword">proposition</span>
    <span class="comment">// Asserting behaviour...</span>
<span class="keyword">end</span></code></pre>

            <p>
                The <span class="keyword">proposition</span> keyword avoids
                the awkward use of <span class="keyword">unittest</span> for
                other kinds of tests such as Integration tests that says <q>Hey! I'm a unit test!</q> but isn't.
                A really nice thing about the D way is that unit test have no
                names which removes the need for writing documentation abstracts
                as function names. There is only a detailed explanation as a comment if needed.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've also used line length as a guide line for designing Owen.
                It is often recommended that lines in a text doesn't exceed 60
                characters. Function signatures can get long quickly. You can in
                many languages split them into multiple lines but that looks
                weird to me. Especially when <code>{</code> comes into play.
                This is where the <span class="keyword">input</span> and
                <span class="keyword">output</span> keywords comes in:
            </p>

            <pre><code><span class="keyword">function</span> test
    <span class="keyword">input</span> <span class="type">i32</span> a,
          <span class="type">i32</span> b

    <span class="keyword">output</span> <span class="type">i32</span>,
           <span class="type">i32</span>

    <span class="keyword">return</span> a,
           b
<span class="keyword">end</span></code></pre>

            <p>
                In a C like language this would look like:
            </p>

            <pre><code>(<span class="type">i32</span>, <span class="type">i32</span>) test(<span class="type">i32</span> a, <span class="type">i32</span> b)
{
    <span class="keyword">return</span> (a, b);
}</code></pre>

            <p>
                This is a trivial example but put on some generics and longer
                type names then the C like function signature will have
                different weather systems at each end of the line. Owen's
                solution comes at a cost of more lines but I'm very curious if
                it is a problem in practice. Note that
                <span class="keyword">input</span> and
                <span class="keyword">output</span> are not statements but are
                part of the function signature.
            </p>

                The next big question is how memory is managed? I experimented
                with Rust since it can figure out when to allocate and free
                memory at compile time due to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.30.0/book/second-edition/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html">Ownership</a>.
                I started programming a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/0">PL/0</a>
                compiler to get a sense of how to use it. While I did get the
                parser going I could not shake the feeling that there was too
                much friction getting there. This could very well just have been
                me fighting the Borrow Checker which seems to be common for
                beginners. Manual memory management it is then. However it might
                be useful to have owned and borrowed pointers be distinct types
                but work the same way. The idea being that the APIs can
                explicitly say who is in charge of the memory but as in clasic C
                its your job to free it if you want to.
