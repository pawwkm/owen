            <p>
                Lately a few problems have become more apparent:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The code base is getting a bit messy because of the list macros
                    and the hoops that have to be made for referencing structs 
                    before they are defined. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The above is also a problem when transpiling to C since structs 
                    in Owen can refer to structs further down.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Compiling debug information is not a picnic either.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                The primary problem is debugging compiled programs on Windows. 
                This could be solved in 3 ways. Use LLVM, reverse engeneer the 
                .pdb format like LLVM <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/PDB/index.html">did</a>
                 or use .NET which has an API for this. <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jmstall/2005/02/03/debugging-dynamically-generated-code-reflection-emit/">Here</a> 
                is an example. Programming the compiler in C# might be the fastest 
                way since it is the language I know best by far.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                So I have chosen to rewrite the compiler in C# and transpile 
                release builds to D since it is much easier to transpile to a subset 
                of D than it is to fit Owen in C. Debug builds are compiled to 
                MSIL. This should result in optimized release builds, 
                pleasant debugging and a bit smaller code base.
